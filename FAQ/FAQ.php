                <div class="faq-body">
                    <p>Our artists are well-rounded and are very experienced in all types of artwork, including both custom work and flash. “Flash” is the term used to describe the design sheets that you see on the walls and in racks at tattoo studios. To check out each artist’s individual style we suggest looking at their portfolios either on this site or in each of our shops.</p>

                <div class="faq-body">
                    <p>A consultation is a free-of-charge, scheduled, 15-minute meeting with a tattoo artist. You can discuss your ideas, bring in any reference art you may have, get a price and time estimation, and ask any questions you may have about your tattoo or the tattoo process in general. From there, if you’d like to go forward, the artist and/or counter will talk to you about booking an appointment.</p>

                <div class="faq-body">
                    <p>Yes. Each artist’s style, pace, questions, and note-taking is different, so make sure to book your consultation with the artist you want to do your tattoo. This ensures that your artist knows exactly what you want and that you guys are on the same page.</p>

                <div class="faq-body">
                    <p>Make sure to bring all reference artwork pertaining to your tattoo. Also, make sure that you’re well fed and hydrated beforehand, and if not, bring food or water with you.  Make sure your clothing will allow access to the area to be tattooed. We will also need a valid form of state or federal ID (Drivers License, Military ID, or Passports are all accepted).</p>

                <div class="faq-body">
                    <p>Everyone’s definition of “hurt” is different because everyone feels pain differently. Unfortunately, there is no real gauge for pain that we can give you without being disingenuous. Some people say that it feels like a cat scratch, and afterwards like a sun burn. Different parts of your body will be more sensitive than others, especially bony parts or areas with thin skin.</p>

                <h1 class="faq-page">How much does a tattoo cost?</h1>
                <div class="faq-body">
                    <p>Our Shop minimum is $150.00. A tattoo the size of a coin, or a small simple outline with no shading is usually considered a shop minimum tattoo.   Tattoos that take a few hours or less are usually quoted outright by the artist.  Larger tattoos (including multiple session pieces) are based on an hourly rate of $200. It’s fairly common for a custom tattoo to take 2 hours, but may cost $500 if that’s the price it was quoted at. On the other hand, a four hour tattoo done at our hourly rate would only cost $800. To use an analogy: buying a dozen roses is cheaper than buying just one, and the artist’s drawing and prep time should be taken into consideration, as we do not charge for these things. If one thinks of tattoo needles as different styles of paint brushes, two different tattoos may be the same size and take the same amount of time to complete, but one may require several different paint brushes to get a specific effect. This requires more set up/prep time, and the paint brushes (tattoo needles) are single use, resulting in a slightly higher cost in materials.  Sales tax is added on to the tattoo total. We require a $50.00 non-refundable deposit in order to hold your appointment ($100 for pieces that will take two hours or more) which will be applied to the cost of your tattoo.</p>

                <div class="faq-body">
                    <p>No, there is no additional charge for custom drawing. The required $50.00 deposit ($100 for pieces that will take over 2 hours) needs to be taken before the artist starts on the piece.</p>

                <div class="faq-body">
                    <p>We generally allow one friend back. However, it depends on the day and the amount of people in the shop. Usually on the weekends we have a number of clients being tattooed and most of our artists here, so it tends to get a little crowded. Also, when massage tables are in use, we ask that clients refrain from having a guest back with them; due to limited space. If there are too many people to have a friend back with you, they can always wait in the gallery and take a look every once in a while.</p>

                    <p>No, none of our artists use the ultraviolet/blacklight pigments because their safety has not been determined.</p>

                <h1 class="faq-page">What should I expect while the tattoo is healing?</h1>
                <div class="faq-body">
                    <p>There are several reactions your skin may have to your new adornment. Your new tattoo will be red, irritated, swollen, warm-to-the-touch, and possibly bruised; this is all normal. It is also normal that some of the ink collects under the bandage or blots off onto your towel after a shower. About the 4th or 5th day into the healing process your tattoo will begin to flake and peel. It is very important that you do not pick or scratch at it; this can truly harm your new tattoo, a light slap will suffice when itching occurs. After the flaking is done the skin will look very shiny for a few weeks.</p>

                <div class="faq-body">
                    <p>Upon arrival for your tattoo we will give you a card that is labeled “tattoo aftercare.” This card is a list of our suggested aftercare for your tattoo. In addition, you will be provided with a high quality aftercare product. We suggest that you remove the bandage after several hours, wash area with a mild, unscented liquid soap and warm water, pat and air dry the tattoo, apply a thin coat of provided aftercare product several times a day. Continue washing, completely drying, and applying aftercare product several times a day until skin stops flaking. Discard aftercare product once tattoo is healed!</p>

                <div class="faq-body">
                    <p>Expose the tattoo to direct sunlight, re-bandage the tattoo (this can suffocate the tattoo, it needs air to help heal), go swimming, go in hot tubs, pools, lakes, rivers, or the ocean, expose the tattoo to excessive steam, submerge the tattoo in water including baths, shave the area, pick or scratch at the tattoo until it is fully healed. Healing time varies from person to person, but most tattoos are healed after two weeks.</p>

                <div class="faq-body">
                    <p> Keep your tattoo clean! Use mild liquid soap and warm water and gently wash the tattoo with your hand (no loofahs, this can scratch and harm the tattoo). Showers are a great way to do this but do not aim the spray directly on the tattoo. Some ink may come off the surface of your skin; this is completely normal and does not mean that ink is leaking or falling out of your tattoo.</p>

                <div class="faq-body">
                    <p>Absolutely! Just make sure to wear loose fitting clothing over the tattoo (rubbing can cause damage to a fresh tattoo). Also make sure that you are especially careful if you work out at a gym.  New tattoos are susceptible to infection and contacting your fresh tattoo to sweaty gym equipment used by numerous people presents a definite risk of infection.</p>

                <div class="faq-body">
                    <p>The best method of keeping your tattoo looking new is to follow the aftercare instructions, make sure your tattoo does not become dry, to not pick at any flaking skin or mild scabbing, avoid immersing a fresh tattoo in water until it is healed, and keep your tattoo out of sunlight by keeping it covered or by using sun block once it is healed. We carry a full range of quality products that aid in keeping the colors and tones in your tattoo rich and vibrant looking.</p>
